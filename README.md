# CSLogApp

Spring Boot Java 8+ HSQL Maven

This is a Java 8+ / Maven / HSQL / Spring Boot application that is used to find long running log events.

Requirements â€¢Java Platform (JDK) 8+

Quick start 1.Clone this project 2.Run in console 3.Check test.log and test.properties to verify results are as expected 4. Please make sure that you have to pass "Logfile.txt" full path in Program Arguments ( for ex: "C:\Test\Log\Logfile.txt")

Testing Instructions

The program should: 1.Take the input file path as input argument. Use following example as test file. Example: {"id":"scsmbstgra", "state":"STARTED", "type":"APPLICATION_LOG", "host":"12345", "timestamp":1491377495212} {"id":"scsmbstgrb", "state":"STARTED", "timestamp":1491377495213} {"id":"scsmbstgrc", "state":"FINISHED", "timestamp":1491377495218} {"id":"scsmbstgra", "state":"FINISHED", "type":"APPLICATION_LOG", "host":"12345", "timestamp":1491377495217} {"id":"scsmbstgrc", "state":"STARTED", "timestamp":1491377495210} {"id":"scsmbstgrb", "state":"FINISHED", "timestamp":1491377495216} 2.Flag any long events that take longer than 4ms with a column in the database called "alert" 3.Write found event details to file-based HSQLDB eventdb in the working folder 4.The application should create a new table if necessary and enter the following values:a. Event idb. Event durationc. Type and Host if applicabled. "alert" set to True if applicable

In the example above, the event scsmbstgrb duration is 1401377495216 - 1491377495213 = 3ms The longest event is scsmbstgrc (1491377495218 - 1491377495210 = 8ms)
